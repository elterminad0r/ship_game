# ship\_game
One of the earlier Python-processing projects. A ship using drag coefficients, and a half-baked autopilot. It has features for random walking using Perlin noise, and for trying to get to a destination (the mouse). Pretty options for exhaust fumes are available. Here is a sample screenshot, using confetti exhaust, with the help of the perlin autopilot:
